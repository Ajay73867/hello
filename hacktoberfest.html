Hello, This file i composed so that people can get an idea about how to get started in Hacktober fest. So for all people information it is a
contest that is held every october in which you have to pull request to different github projects and then you have to fix the issue or you can
create new file which could be helpful to others or just write hello world. This file that i am writing is alos part of hacktoberfest thanks
