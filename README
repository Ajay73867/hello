Hello World!
1. Concepts of Git
Version Control System (VCS): Version Control System is a software that helps in tracking changes in source code over time. Git is a distributed version control system, enabling collaboration among multiple developers.
Repository: A repository (repo) is a storage space where the version-controlled files and their history are stored.
Commit: A commit is a snapshot of changes made to the repository. Each commit has a unique identifier.
Branch: A branch is a parallel version of the code. Creating branches allows developers to work on features or bug fixes independently.
Merge: Merging combines changes from different branches into a single branch.
Pull Request (PR): A pull request is a proposal to merge changes from one branch into another. It allows for code review and collaboration before merging.
Fork: Forking is a process of creating a personal copy of someone else's project. Changes made in the forked repository can be submitted as pull requests.

2. Basic Git Commands
git init
git add <filename>
git commit -m "Commit message"
git branch <branch_name>
git checkout <branch_name>
git merge <branch_name>
git status
git log

3. Concepts on GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket
GitHub: GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories. It facilitates collaboration, code review, and issue tracking.
GitLab: GitLab is a web-based DevOps lifecycle tool that provides source code repositories, CI/CD pipelines, and project management features.
BitBucket: BitBucket is a Git repository hosting service that integrates with other Atlassian products. It offers source code collaboration and version control.

4. Industrial Practices of Using Git
Feature Branches: Developers work on feature branches to isolate changes, making it easier to manage and review before merging.
Pull Requests: All changes are proposed through pull requests, allowing for peer review and automated testing.
Continuous Integration (CI): CI systems automatically build and test code changes, ensuring that each commit is stable.
Code Reviews: Code reviews are essential for maintaining code quality. Teams use pull requests to review and discuss code changes.

5. Cloning a Repo to Local
git clone <repository_url>
This command downloads the entire repository and its history to your local machine, allowing you to work on the code locally.
