Concepts of Git
1 Version Control
Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time. Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously.
2 Repository
A repository (repo) is a collection of files and their history. Repositories can be local or remote.
3 Commit
A commit is a snapshot of changes made to files in a repository. Commits help in tracking the project's history.
4 Branch
A branch is a parallel version of a repository, allowing developers to work on different features or bug fixes simultaneously.
5 Merge
Merging combines changes from different branches. It is essential to integrate changes made in one branch into another.
6 Pull Request
A pull request (PR) is a proposed change to a repository. It's a way to notify others about changes you've made and request their review.
Basic Git Commands
1 Initializing a Repository
git init
2 Checking Status
git status
3 Adding Changes
git add <filename>
4 Committing Changes
git commit -m "Commit message"
5 Creating a Branch
git branch <branch_name>
6 Switching Branches
git checkout <branch_name>
7 Merging Branches
git merge <branch_name>
8 Cloning a repository
git clone <repository_url>
9 Pushing changes
git push <remote_name> <branch_name>
10 Pulling changes
git pull <remote_name> <branch_name>
Concepts on GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket
1 GitHub
GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration. It provides features like pull requests, code review, and issue tracking.
2 GitLab
GitLab is a web-based Git repository manager that provides source code management, continuous integration, and more.
3 BitBucket
BitBucket is a Git repository management solution by Atlassian. It supports both Git and Mercurial, providing features like code collaboration and CI/CD.
Industrial Practices of Using Git
1 Branching Strategy
Adopting a branching strategy (e.g., Gitflow) helps organize development efforts, separating features, releases, and hotfixes.
2 Code Reviews
Implementing code reviews ensures code quality, catches bugs early, and facilitates knowledge sharing among team members.
