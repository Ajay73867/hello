Git and GitHub


Git is a version control system that allows developers to track changes in their codes.It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project, making it easier to manage and merge changes.


GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories. 




1.Concepts of Git explaining various terms. 


* Repository
            A repository or ‘repo’ is a place where we can store our codes, files and file history.
            It is the  most  basic element of GitHub and it can be either local or remote.


* Commit
            It is used to record changes in the repository.
     
* Cloning
            Cloning means we are making a copy of the repository in our system.


* Forking
            Forking means creating a copy of our repository which allows us to make independent
            changes without affecting the original repository. 


* Branch
            Branch is a separate version of our repository. It allows us to work on the different
            versions of our repository at the same time. 


* Merge
            It allows us to combine the changes from different branches into a single branch. 


* Pull Request
            It lets us tell others about the changes we have pushed to a branch in a repository.


















2.  Basic commands of git.


* git config -This command helps us to configure variables that control various aspects on how git looks and operates. 


* git init - It is used to initialize a new git repository.


* git clone - It is used to download an existing git repository on our local computer 


* git add - It allows us to add all the local changes of our working copy to the   staging area(index) so that those changes can be committed to our local repository.


*  git commit - It records changes to the repository.


* Git log - For viewing commit history.


*  git branch - It allows us to determine what branch the local repository is on.


*  git checkout - For switching branch.


*  git push - It is used to push the contents from a local repository to a remote repository.


*  git pull - It is used to incorporate new changes from the remote repository.


*  git merge - It is used to combine changes from different branches into a single branch.
